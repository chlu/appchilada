Appchilada - Live app metric awesomeness
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

Appchilada is an app metric monitoring tool. It's a high performance aggregator of app data (for now timings and event counts) that can push data to various backends.

## INSTALLATION

Appchilada is built using _godag_, a tool to simplify building of Go projects with subpackages. A Go makefile is included that can be built using the default Go toolchain:

    $ 8g _gdmk.go
    $ 8l -o gdmk _gdmk.8
    $ ./gdmk

Make sure all the Go environment variables are set correctly.
